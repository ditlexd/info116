Certainly the world will never do much good until the attitude mind for which the Japanese stand is obliterated. And there are 'planes standing by, ready to obliterate them. But the horror that attends the use of this new weapon is very great. not entirely matter of "this might have happened us." There is something deeper, more human, and more decent, behind it.

 are that may bring the war to a speedy conclusion without the sacrifice of more valuable British and American lives. The Japanese, of course, are fanatical. With tangible foe every man capable of bearing arms might well fight until he was killed, and the killing might be long drawn out and expensive in the lives of our young men. Whether it will be so when the Japanese realise that they cannot combat this new menace, but can only wait until they are wiped out, or at least their manufactures and their communications, their troops and their means of getting these troops to the fighting front, is another matter. Already there are signs of a weakening of spirit in face of this new menace. It would not be right to glory too much over it, though some of its manifestations are positively nauseating by reason of their hypocrisy. <div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-n"></div><div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-e"></div><div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-s"></div><div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-w"></div><div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-se ui-icon ui-icon-gripsmall-diagonal-se ui-icon-grip-diagonal-se" style="z-index: 1001;"></div><div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-sw" style="z-index: 1002;"></div><div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-ne" style="z-index: 1003;"></div><div class="ui-resizable-handle ui-resizable-nw" style="z-index: 1004;"></div>
